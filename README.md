# The-Lorenz-Attractor
Lorenz System is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. This repository contains a simple Octave/MATLAB code to generate the 3D plot of the Lorenz Attractor.
